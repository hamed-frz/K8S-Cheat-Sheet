## Installing and Configuration the Calico Network Plugin

Calico is a networking and network security solution for containers that can be used within Kubernetes. It provides high-performance networking and features like network policies for security. Follow these steps to install and verify the Calico network plugin in your Kubernetes cluster.

### Steps to Install Calico

1. **Install the Calico network plugin:**

    Apply the Calico manifest to your cluster to install the network plugin.

    ```bash
    kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.28.1/manifests/tigera-operator.yaml
    kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.28.1/manifests/custom-resources.yaml
    ```
    Node: Before creating this manifest, read its contents and make sure its settings are correct for your environment. For example, you may need to change the default IP pool CIDR to match your pod network CIDR.
    This command deploys Calico in the `kube-system` namespace and configures it to manage networking for your cluster.
    
2. **Verify the installation:**

    After applying the Calico manifest, check the status of the Calico pods to ensure they are running correctly.

    ```bash
    kubectl get po -n kube-system
    ```

    All Calico-related pods should be in the `Running` state.

3. **Install the Calico CLI tool (`calicoctl`):**

    Download and install the `calicoctl` CLI tool, which allows you to manage Calico resources and configurations.

    ```bash
    curl -o calicoctl -O -L https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/releases/download/v3.28.1/calicoctl-linux-amd64
    chmod +x calicoctl
    sudo mv calicoctl /usr/local/bin/
    calicoctl get ippools
    calicoctl node status
    ```

    This tool can be used to interact with Calico directly, providing a command-line interface for advanced network policy management and troubleshooting.
